I like to set VSCode workspace settings to format on save and commit those setting to the repo. This enables me to:

-   Never need to waste brain power on formatting
-   Never have commits that are just formatting
-   Never have arguments about formatting with colleagues
-   Never waste time with linters complaining about formatting

I simply gave up having my own opinions on formatting, trust Prettier's opinions and waste less time.

## Setup

Install the VsCode extension `esbenp.prettier-vscode`. This is the only manual that every coder has to do, the rest is done once and commited to the repo.

`npm i --save-dev prettier`

    -   Needed to run as a npm script
    -   Keeps the version used consistent
    -   This also makes it possible to use plugins to support more files

Create settings file for the project `./.vscode/settings.json`:

```json settings.json
{
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "[html][js][css][ts][jsx][tsx]": {
        // VSCode's default tab size does not match prettier.
        "editor.tabSize": 2
    }
}
```

-   Format all files once with `npx prettier ./src/ -w`
-   Add any generated files to a `.prettierignore`
    -   `.git` and `node_modules` should be ignored by default

## Enjoy

Enjoy clean commits, more time to bikeshed on things that are not formatting.
