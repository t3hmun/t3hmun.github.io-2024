I decided it is time I had a simple reliable website and personal blog.
I the past I've written my own static site generators to create my personal site.
Those projects we good for learning, however they were all abandoned when the thing I was learning stopped being fun or interesting.

This time I'm using an existing established framework, I am not planning to re-invent the wheel (yet).

I picked [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) because it has clean HTML output without JS by default, perfectly suited to a static website.
It also lets me do a lot more, which is inevitably what I want to do.

## Setup

### Astro Site Generation via GitHub Actions

-   `npm create astro@latest -- --template blog` default / yes all options
-   Delete unwanted pages and images
-   Fix `config.ts` metadata
-   Update url in `astro.config.mjs`
-   Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` using [these instructions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/).
-   Now it works.

### Domain

-   Change `Pages` settings in the github repo ot point to my www domain
-   Update CNAME record to point to `t3hmun.github.io`
-   Done.

## Success

I've done everything needed, this is now a working site that publishes itself automatically when anything new is pushed.
