## What

This is not an article, this is here for testing markdown -> article output and seeing how well my css works.

## Notes

A few general rules for writing new markdown blog posts make thing work well:

-   For the sake of consistency and nice sorting in file manager the post's file name should use the format: `yyyy-MM-dd-lower-case-title.md`.
-   Every post should start with a front-matter block similar to:

```md
---
title: "Feature Reference"
description: "A test page of everything that can be output when writing pages for this website in markdown."
timestmap: "2022-11-02T23:30:00Z"
---
```

-   The title will automatically be inserted as the one and only `h1` of the page
-   The description is the only optional field, it is used in indexes / sets of links of posts
-   The timestamp should be of the format `yyyy-mm-ddThh:MM:ssZ`, always UTC, ISO style.

## Headings

See the top of the page for the `h1`. As a general rule I only ever have a single `h1` on any page, it is the title and start of the main content.
The heading directly above this text should be a `h2`.

The text under every heading is a demonstration of a paragraph of text, a `p` tag, mostly extracts taken from the [Wikipedia page on Johannes Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg).

### Header 3

Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg (/ˈɡuːtənbɜːrɡ/; c. 1400 – 3 February 1468) was a German inventor, printer, publisher, and goldsmith who introduced printing to Europe with his mechanical movable-type printing press.

His work started the Printing Revolution in Europe and is regarded as a milestone of the second millennium, ushering in the modern period of human history.

#### Header 4

Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-nationalism, accelerated by the flowering of the European vernacular languages to the detriment of Latin's status as lingua franca. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale, while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.

##### Header 5

The relatively unrestricted circulation of information—including revolutionary ideas—transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation, and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class.

###### H6

A h6. Hopefully these are not needed.

## Images

TODO: Sample images

-   A default image using pure markdown
-   Using some custom css:
    -   A small image shown at true size, less wide than the normal reading text area.
    -   An image that fill the width of the reading text, scale with it.
    -   An image that fills the middle-width area and scales with it.
    -   An image that fills the content width area and scale with it.

## Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a `footer` or `cite` element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.

#### Blockquote without attribution

> It is tempting to incorrectly use blockquotes asides and information boxes.

#### Blockquote with attribution

> Franz Liszt (22 October 1811 – 31 July 1886) was a Hungarian composer, pianist and teacher of the Romantic period. With a diverse body of work spanning more than six decades, he is considered to be one of the most prolific and influential composers of his era and remains one of the most popular composers in modern concert piano repertoire.<br/>

## Tables

| Italics   | Bold     | Code   |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| _italics_ | **bold** | `code` |

## Code Blocks

You may notice that the code blocks use the full content width.
Code often needs the extra horizontal space.
There is no shortage of code that greatly exceeds 80 characters a line.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Example HTML5 Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Test sdfsdfsd</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

This is some writing, a paragraph of text followed by an aside, which is the followed by another paragraph.

<aside>This is an aside, some tangential information.</aside>

As you can see I haven't thought about how to format the aside properly.
Maybe it should be formatted like the example in [the MDN page for aside](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside).
